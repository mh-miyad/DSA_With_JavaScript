Certainly! Let's dive into some detailed array-related questions that you can solve:

1. **Find a Peak Element**:
   Given an array of integers, find an element that is not smaller than its neighbors. For example:
   ```
   Input: [1, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2]
   Output: 5 (index 3)
   ```
   You can solve this using binary search.

2. **Reverse an Array**:
   Write a program to reverse the order of elements in an array. For example:
   ```
   Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   ```

3. **Sort an Array**:
   Implement an algorithm to sort a given array. You can use any sorting technique (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).

4. **Subarray with Given Sum**:
   Given an array of integers and a target sum, find a subarray whose sum equals the target value. For example:
   ```
   Input: [1, 4, 20, 3, 10, 5], target = 33
   Output: [20, 3, 10]
   ```

5. **Move Negative Elements to One Side**:
   Rearrange an array so that all negative elements appear before positive elements. For example:
   ```
   Input: [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
   Output: [-1, -3, -5, 2, 4]
   ```

6. **Union and Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays**:
   Given two sorted arrays, compute their union (all distinct elements) and intersection (common elements).

7. **Find the Kth Largest and Kth Smallest Number**:
   Find the Kth largest and Kth smallest elements in an array. For example:
   ```
   Input: [3, 1, 4, 2, 5], K = 3
   Kth largest: 3
   Kth smallest: 3
   ```

8. **First Repeating and Non-Repeating Elements**:
   Find the first repeating and first non-repeating elements in an array. For example:
   ```
   Input: [2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 4]
   First repeating: 2
   First non-repeating: 3
   ```

9. **Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   Compute the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. For example:
   ```
   Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
   Output: 6 (subarray [4, -1, 2, 1])
   ```

10. **Matrix Spiral Traversal**:
    Print the elements of a matrix in a spiral manner. For example:
    ```
    Input:
    [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ]
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
    ```
