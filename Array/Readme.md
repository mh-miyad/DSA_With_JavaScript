## Array

### Array Methods

- `push()`: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- `pop()`: Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
- `shift()`: Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
- `unshift()`: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- `concat()`: Returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the elements of one or more other arrays.
- `slice()`: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included).
- `splice()`: Changes the content of an array by adding or removing elements.
- `map()`: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
- `filter()`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- `reduce()`: Apply a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
- `every()`: Checks if every element in an array satisfies the provided testing function.
- `some()`: Checks if at least one element in the array satisfies the provided testing function.
- `find()`: Returns the value of the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.
- `findIndex()`: Returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
- `indexOf()`: Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
- `includes()`: Determines whether an array contains a certain element.
- `join()`: Combines all elements of an array into a string.
- `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the array.
- `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the elements of an array in place.
- `sort()`: Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.
- `copyWithin()`: Copies a sequence of array elements within the array.

### Sorting

- `Array.prototype.sort([compareFunction])`: Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.
- `compareFunction`: Optional. Specifies a function that defines the sort order. If omitted, the array is sorted according to each character's Unicode (UTF-16) code point value.

### Array Iteration

- `for...of` loop: Used to iterate over the elements in an array.
- `forEach()`: Calls a function for each array element.

### Array Searching

- `indexOf()`: Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
- `includes()`: Determines whether an array contains a certain element.
- `find()`: Returns the value of the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.
- `findIndex()`: Returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.

### Array Manipulation

- `push()`: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- `pop()`: Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
- `shift()`: Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
- `unshift()`: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- `splice()`: Changes the content of an array by adding or removing elements.
- `concat()`: Returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the elements of one or more other arrays.

### Array Conversion

- `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the array.
- `join()`: Combines all elements of an array into a string.

### Array Access

- `accessing an array element`: Access an array element using its index.

### Array Length

- `length`: Returns the number of elements in an array.

### Array Mutability

- `mutable`: In JavaScript, arrays are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after they are created.
